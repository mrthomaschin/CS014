# CS014

  This class was an introduction to essential data structures including stacks, queues, trees, hashs, and graphs. A lot of the class focused on run-time, specifically Big-O, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta notation. We learned algorithm analysis and different types of sorting algorithms as well.
  
  In this class we had assignments that focused on the mathematical aspect, such as run-time analysis, and labs that allowed us to implement the data structures we learned and use it hands-on.
  
  I personally enjoyed this class because I believe this is what defines Software Engineering. Many believe that Software Engineering and Computer Science is learning how to type numbers and words to create a program, but there is art to writing good code. Through this class I learned that there are many tools that engineers have access to, and the primary objective is to use these tools to create fast, working code as efficiently as possible.
